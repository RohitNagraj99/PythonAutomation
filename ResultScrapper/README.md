# MSRIT Result Scrapper
This script scrapes all results from the exam.msrit.edu website and stores it in a text file.

## Usage
Change the USNs according to your requirements, run the script. Enter the captcha once prompted. That's it!

## Bugs
It doesn't handle the USNs that are not present and waits infinitely.
